instagrab
====================

##Description
Serving as my final project for The Iron Yard Academy's front end web development course, Instagrab is a web-app inspired by my own want for a feature that Instagram's website and mobile app both lack. I often want to go back in my own feed and find photos that I've tagged, but the tag search yields results from all users around the world. Though this is a useful feature in cases where one is trying to discover users with similar interests, I primarily use instagram (like most users, I would assume) in order to document moments and memories that I would later like to revisit.
